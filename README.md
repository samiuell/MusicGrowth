# MusicGrowth

## Purpose 
This program was created for the course ICS4UI, in which we were tasked with the challenge to develop a simulator that allowed the user to play with different values. This Processing program simulates the growth of both fans and haters for an aspiring musician, and depicts their exponential growth in the industry. 

## Changeable Values
In the "musicGrowth" file you can see the changeable values at the top of the code, commented with what they do. Changing these values will manipulate the simulation and display different scenarios.

### Set-up
You can change how many cells are in each row and column to change the size of the grid, and choose whether you want to turn on gridlines to clearly see each cell. You can also change the frame rate to either slow down or quicken the simulation and observe the spreading rate of fans and haters. 

### Setting
You can also choose between the city, rural, random, or custom settings which will change the initial value of fans and haters, as well as how fast they spread. This is to simulate the differences in music culture between different types of communities, and how much more support there is for a musician in a city as opposed to a community with not as many people to share your art with. By choosing the custom setting, you can enter in your own values and manipulate the simulation as you desire. 

### Shows 
At any point during the simulation you can click anywhere on the grid and generate a "show" at that spot. Each performance will generate new fans and haters, and you can perform as many shows as you'd like.
